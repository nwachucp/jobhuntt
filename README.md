Click **“Use this template”** or download the ZIP. OR CLICK GREEN CODE BUTTON AND COPY TEMPLATE

## 2. Add Your Info

Open `config.json` and update:

  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "keywords": ["developer", "remote", "python", "ai"],
  "resume_path": "resume.pdf"
}

3. Replace Your Resume

Upload your resume into the root folder and rename it exactly:

4. Connect Airtable (Logging System)

Step 1: Create a Token
Go to: https://airtable.com/account
Click “Create token”
Name it: JobBot
Select these Scopes:
data.records:read
data.records:write
schema.bases:read
Under Access, select:
Your workspace
The base you're using for logging (e.g. “job bot logs”)
Click Create token and Copy it

Step 2: Get Your Base ID and Table ID
Go to: https://airtable.com/api
Click your base (e.g. “job bot logs”)
Copy these:
Base ID → starts with app...
Table ID (under Table 1) → starts with tbl...

Step 3: Set Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory or add them in Railway under “Environment”:

AIRTABLE_TOKEN      = your_token_here
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID    = your_base_id_here
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME = your_table_id_here

✅ Make sure your Time_stamp field in Airtable is set to:
